Presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1obaWWSiWTeHr3bYDxal9hmJ3GWxsTIpDBZtQgdUjxIk/edit?usp=sharing

To create the animated gifs from screen I used https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207


Node (Ball) :   id 13
                point (10, 10, 10)
                trio_id 3
                link to: 8, 17, 22

Trio :  id: 3
        Conn 1: CN04 ( -1, -1,  0)
        Conn 2: CP07 (  1,  0, -1)
        Conn 3: CP08 (  0,  1,  1)

Draw Ball id 13
draw sphere at (10, 10, 10)
draw 3 lines pops out:
    conn1: (10, 10, 10) -> ( 9, 9, 0)
